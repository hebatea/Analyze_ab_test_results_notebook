# Summary

This is an A/B testing assignment completed for Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. 
The project consisted of understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and helping the company understand through statistical conclusions, 
if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

# Objectives
* practice working on A/B testing projects and their practical difficulties
* perform A/B tests and make recommendations backed by computed inferences

# Data Set
I have used two data-set in this project
* ab_data.csv
* countries.csv

# How to run the script
This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. You need to install anaconda and run jupyter notebook to run this script.

The libaraies that I used in this notebook are:
